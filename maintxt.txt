        Sketching - for as long as i've known, i always love to draw

        Reading - can you even consider this my hobby if i've only read a 
        couple of books? the genres i like are: fiction, mystery, fantasy, satire,
        legend, and drama - to name a few. My favorite read definitely goes to 
        "A Series of Unfortunate Events" - a series of 13 novels made by Lemony Snicket,
        about the ill-fated lives of the Baudelaire children: this series has death, comedy, 
        dark humor, absurd situations; these are the factors that makes this book a favorite
        of mine.
