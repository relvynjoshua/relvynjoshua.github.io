            Relvyn Joshua U. Cagadas also known as Relvs and Wawa. <br>
            Born on October 14, 2002 - at Madonna and Child Hospital. <br>
            i am 20 years old and i live in Iponan, Cagayan de Oro City. <br>
            i have 2 siblings - both are girls, before i came along i had <br>
            2 older siblings. best qualities are being friendly, kind, and, <br>
            helpful when others are in need of help. Worst qualities are <br>
            apathetic at times, stubborn, and annoying.

            Likes listening to music and singing to it, binge watching <br>
            shows, sleeping, and thrifting. Dislikes participating in <br>
            events, talking in front of a crowd, 12am to 2pm sun, and <br>
            more i think.

            <b>Sketching</b> - for as long as i've known myself, i <br> 
            always love to draw from drawing figures to still life. <br> 
            There are some subjects i have yet to draw and learn <br>
            from, i have yet to find my artsyle and make my art <br>
            somewhat perfect. I strive to make many pieces to display <br>
            and interpret my self in those works and show the world <br>
            what i can do. You never know this could be a side hustle.

            <b>Reading</b> - can you even consider this my hobby if i've <br>
            only read a couple of books? the genres i like are: fiction, <br>
            mystery, fantasy, satire, legend, and drama - to name a few. <br>
            My favorite read definitely goes to "A Series of Unfortunate <br>
            Events" - a series of 13 novels made by Lemony Snicket, <br>
            about the ill-fated lives of the Baudelaire children: this <br>
            series has death, comedy, dark humor, absurd situations; these <br>
            are the factors that makes this book a favorite of mine.

            <b>Playing video games</b> - the games i play are: league of <br>
            legends, valorant, genshin impact, punishing gray raven, <br>
            granblue fantasy, mobile legends; just to name a few. half of my <br>
            leisure time is dedicated to these games - stress inducing but <br>
            fun. Thinking of video games makes me want to create one myself <br>
            - maybe in the future i'll get to that.

            <b>What i plan to do?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Travel the world - a dream of mine since the beginning, <br>
            travelling the world meeting new people and discovering <br>
            places, food, culture, and the like. Money would pose a <br>
            problem i guess, i'll make sure to strive for the <br>
            betterment of my future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grow old - this has been on my mind lately, how things don't <br>
            go well with some of the individuals in this lifetime - made me <br>
            realize time is fleeting, make most of it: next thing you know <br>
            you'll be sleeping, forever and not on your bed. i want to <br>
            grow old and healthy to experience everything in my life, <br>
            brush off the negative things. i imagine myself in a house by <br>
            the sea, staring at the horizon, remembering my time.
