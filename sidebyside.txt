            <b>Sketching</b> - for as long as i've known myself, i <br> 
            always love to draw from drawing figures to still life. <br> 
            There are some subjects i have yet to draw and learn <br>
            from, i have yet to find my artsyle and make my art <br>
            somewhat perfect. I strive to make many pieces to display 
            and interpret my self in those works and show the world <br>
            what i can do. You never know this could be a side hustle.

            <b>Reading</b> - can you even consider this my hobby if i've <br>
            only read a couple of books? the genres i like are: fiction, <br>
            mystery, fantasy, satire, legend, and drama - to name a few. <br>
            My favorite read definitely goes to "A Series of Unfortunate <br>
            Events" - a series of 13 novels made by Lemony Snicket, <br>
            about the ill-fated lives of the Baudelaire children: this <br>
            series has death, comedy, dark humor, absurd situations; these <br>
            are the factors that makes this book a favorite of mine.

            <b>Playing video games</b> - the games i play are: league of <br>
            legends, valorant, genshin impact, punishing gray raven, <br>
            granblue fantasy, mobile legends; just to name a few. half of my <br>
            leisure time is dedicated to these games - stress inducing but <br>
            fun. Thinking of video games makes me want to create one myself <br>
            - maybe in the future i'll get to that.
